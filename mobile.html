            I worked on a few projects but these are the ones i worked on a pip more seriously: <br> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Lunar</summary> Lunar is a Discord bot I made that's
                        basically everything a bot needs but sadly due to other projects and priorities it's
                        been offline for quite some time.
                    </details>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary> Smaller Bots </summary> These are some smaller bots i made that never really took off
                        and if i ever get some free time I will merge them with Sheer Heart Attack. They include
                        features like OCR for messages and auto threads.
                    </details>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary> Captcha for Team Fortress 2 </summary> As TF2 is swarmed with cheater bots i tried to
                        develop a solution to stop the bots before they even join the game. As many others this project
                        was also left unfinished because of other,
                        more interesting ones. Additionally, this idea would probably not work so i would just largely
                        waste my time trying to fight the source spaghetti monster.
                    </details>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary> Schoolr </summary> Schoolr is an app to help struggling students manage their time
                        better and help them keep track of their grades, GPA, averages and tests. It's not finished yet
                        but i am making a lot of progress and it will
                        probably be finished before February of 2022 so i decided to list it here.

                    <details>
                        <summary> Avatar: The game </summary> This project with an insanely unoriginal name is, as the
                        name suggests a VR game focused on Avatar: The last airbender and it's fighting. I decided upon
                        it being a PVP-centered open world RPG. That's
                        everything i can reveal for now ( ;) ) but this project might take a (very) long time to
                        complete even if i am making lots of progress as i am indeed one person and an entire game is no
                        simple task. I still decided to include
                        it in this list as when/if i finish it it could be one of my biggest projects, and I spend most
                        of my time these days working on it.

                    <details>
                        <summary> This website </summary> This website, even if it's nothing spectacular was masterfully
                        made in 4 days and I'm so proud of myself for making it (for some reason) that im listing it
                        here. As you can see i went for a Windows 98
                        look and if you are reading this on the finished version of the website nearly everything is
                        functional. UPDATE: Future me here, i might make everything functional one day but there is no
                        point tbh, the site is fine in this
                        state
